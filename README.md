We are a motivated Student Cluster Competition Team at Nanchang University, has participated in the ASC Student Supercomputer Challenge for 9 years. As the host of the finals in 2018, our school welcomed excellent supercomputing talents from all over the world. Our best result in ASC is the first prize.Now, we are trying to **challenge the broader boundaries of supercomputing** and **attempting to establish extensive connections with more supercomputing universities**.

Nanchang University is the only 211 project university in Jiangxi Province, which devotes significant efforts to computer science research, especially on high-performance computing (HPC). HPC enables the blossom of Artificial Intelligence and Data-intensive business nowadays. Thus, HPC shall be considered as the foundation of the cutting-edge computer science and technique. Nanchang University has already investigated and successfully built the largest distributed high-performance clusters for educational purpose in the mid-west region of China. The peak performance is 100 TFlop, based on a carefully-designed heterogeneous architecture.

## 2023

**Before we take part in SC23, we are going to USTC to observe [ASC22 Final](http://www.asc-events.net/ASC22/index.php)**

**We will be participating in [SC23 SCC](https://studentclustercompetition.us/) in Denver, USA, under the leadership of [Ke Chen](https://kechen666.github.io/EnglishPage.html).**

Although we have no prior experience in this competition, we firmly believe that we can do our best. **(Try to beat THU haha!!)**

## 2022

**We won two second prizes in [ASC22](http://www.asc-events.net/ASC22/Preliminary/) (all ranks top 8%) under the leadership of [Ruobing Yao](https://good.ncu.edu.cn/~yrb/) and Yuxuan Li.** 

During this competition, we have overcome Yuan Large Language Model Challenge and DeePMD Challenge.

### YUAN LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL CHALLENGE

Training large-scale language model like Yuan is difficult because it requires not only massive computing resources, but also complex training methods to efficiently process a large number of parameters. We complete Yuan Large Language Model Chanllenge in 67.75h using 4 32GB Tesla V100 DGXS, ZeRO parallel strategy and various acceleration training methods.

Our solution will be open-sourced soon. 

### DeePMD CHALLENGE

Traditional models applied in molecular dynamics (MD) usually are density functional theory (DFT) models and empirical force fields (EFF)-based models. The former has a quantum mechanical precision but can not handle large system, while as the latter is efficient but are limited by the transferability of the model. In recent years, machine learning based on MD(MLMD) methods tackle this dilemma.As one of such model, Deep Potential achieve the balance between accuracy and efficiency.

DeePMD-kit is a realization of Deep Potential, it is a deep learning package for many-body potential energy representation and molecular dynamics, which can written in Python/C++. In this challenge,we are required to make improvements on the training procedure. We end up with the speed results that are **7.946(watewr), 3.121(mgalcu), 1.728(copper)** compared to the original results, **through the optimization of custom operators,Compressed Training**.  

Our solution will be open-sourced soon. 

## 2020-2021

**We won two second prizes in ASC20-21 (all ranks top 8%) under the leadership of Haichuan Hu and Sheng Yi**

During this competition, we have overcome Language Exam Challenge, QuEST Challenge and PRESTO Challenge.
